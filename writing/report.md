### Article 1
 -  Article name.
 - 10 hot data analytics trends -- and 5 going gold

-  Reference or article citation.
 - Heller, Martin. 10 Hot Data Analytics Trends - and 5 Going Cold. 7 Aug. 2017, www.cio.com/article/3213189/10-hot-data-analytics-trends-and-5-going-cold.html. 

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - Discusses 10 popular trends of companies using user data to personalize and improve the user experience and capability

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - One technique "heating up" is the R Programming language. This language is very popular with user data analysis and thusly, user data. Almost all the packages for anything you can imagine is inside R. It has deep neural networks is open source so everyone can see exactly what it does but it also does give people with malicious intent access to these potentially dangerous tools. 

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - Any data you want. R is incredibly versatile so the options are limitless

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - The focus here is on using machine learning and neural nets. We still can't see what it is going on inside a neural net or machine learning but we can see the outcome which comes with some potential ethical concerns.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - It really depends on the way data scientists and programmers decide to implement it. There are always ethical concerns no matter what but both parties have some potential to gain something. I think the bigger concern is companies using this tool to mine data, sell data, or invade personal privacy which is multiplied by companies having an incentive to make money and how quick quick techniques are being developed which makes it hard for governments to keep up with making laws.


### Article 2
 -  Article name.
 - 5 Cool Ways Companies Are Using Big Data

-  Reference or article citation.
 - Gorini, Maria. "5 Cool Ways Companies Are Using Big Data." Bismart.Com, 2019, blog.bismart.com/en/ways-companies-are-using-big-data.

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - I'm focusing on the eHarmony use case. They are using user data collected through wearables including sleeping patterns, heart rate, physical activity, and diet to name a few.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - If this is just used for the general purpose of helping eHarmony find your "perfect match" it seems fine ethically but if they might sell it or save it somewhere for later, this could be a huge ethical concern. These seemingly obscure vitals could be used by companies or the government to unnecessarily control your life.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - Vitals and data related to daily activities.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - It uses this data to find your "perfect match". Maybe people that tend to eat at the same times of day might mesh well or people that are both active mesh well. The applications are valid.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Definitely the users but also the company that created this since popularity means increased traffic which means more capital for them.
